# String Calculator

This project is a simple implementation of a String Calculator following the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach. The calculator can sum a string of comma-separated numbers, handle new lines, and support custom delimiters. It also checks for negative numbers and show related message when they are found.

## Features

- Handles an empty string and returns `0`.
- Supports single numbers and sums of two or more numbers.
- Allows new lines in addition to commas as delimiters.
- Supports custom delimiters defined at the beginning of the string.
